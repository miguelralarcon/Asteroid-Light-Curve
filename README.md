Most asteroids do not have a symmetrical shape or a constant albedo. This results in a fluctuation of the magnitude of the asteroid while it is rotating. Because the rotation is periodic this results in a periodic magnitude difference. Thus the rotational period can be determined from measuring the light curve and fitting the best period.

In this Notebook, a Lomb-Scargle periodogram is obtained to infer the best rotation period and fit a Fourier series to the photometrical data.
